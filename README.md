## 🚧 The code will be uploaded soon!

We kindly ask that you cite the above-mentioned paper if you use this **Alliance Framework** in your research or publish work based on these codes.

## Overview

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of an **Alliance for Uncertainty Quantification**, a model-agnostic framework that integrates *Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems* with *Conformal Prediction* to calibrate the prediction intervals of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems and generate high-quality prediction intervals. 

The repository contains:
- A `simulate.m` script to run experiments and save results into a structure.
- A `getResults.m` script to post-process the results and generate the tables and figures used in the paper.

Please note that the numerical results might vary due to random seed variation (`simulate.m` line 97)
If you prefer not to re-run the simulations, you can directly use the .mat files in `paper results` and proceed with `getResults.m`.

> *Feel free to explore, experiment, and build on top of this work. Contributions, feedback, and extensions are always welcome.*
